dde-qt-dbus-factory
===================

dde-qt-dbus-factory is a repository stores auto-generated Qt5 dbus code. It can ease the pain that every dde developer have to re-generate code for the same dbus interface or have to copy code from other dde projects doing there new projects.

*NOTE: USE qdbusxml2cpp-fix to generate dbus code instead of the original qdbusxml2cpp.*

qdbusxml2cpp-fix is included in the tools dir.
